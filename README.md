![Optional video instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWRMiBIQ-b8&t=306s)

To get started after installing the vanilla AS game, we want to install 3 things:
 1. Content Manager - This will become the game launcher and mod manager (![content manager download link](https://assettocorsa.club/content-manager.html))
 2. CSP - Custom Shader Patch is an installation available within Content Manager > Settings > Custom Shader Patch. Ensure you are downloading `v0.1.78` or greater
 3. SOL - Sol is a weather simulation system / shader patch (you will need a Race Department account to see the download button) :  (![sol download link](https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/sol.24914/))
